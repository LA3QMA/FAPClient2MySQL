FAPClient2MySQL
===============

Using FAP.pl to store data into MySQL
The main purpose for this project is to enable APRSC to store data.

We have not decided what and where we want to store to MySQL.
So for now we store data in the same way as javaaprssrv.

You need:
Ham-APRS-FAP - http://search.cpan.org/dist/Ham-APRS-FAP/
APRSC        - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aprsc
